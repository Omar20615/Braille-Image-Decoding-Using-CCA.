# Braille-Image-Decoding-Using-CCA.

In this project, I applied Connected Component Analysis (CCA) to decode Braille sequences from images. Here's a brief description:

V Set Definition with 8-Connectivity CCA:
I utilized 8-connectivity based CCA to separate Braille sequences from the background, ensuring proper extraction of Braille cells in the images.

Region Analysis and Decoding Algorithm:
The extracted regions were analyzed based on the Braille pattern (3x2 dot matrix). I developed a decoding algorithm that mapped the dot combinations to corresponding English characters.

Braille to English Translation:
Using the decoding algorithm, I translated the Braille sequences from the images into readable English text, ensuring that the system was robust for various image inputs.
